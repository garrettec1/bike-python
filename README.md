This program is just some example code I am working on from a book. Practical
Object-Oriented Design Ruby: An Agile primer. By Sandi Metz.

I am using the ruby examples, and translating them to python code. I figure if I
can implement the ruby code effectively in pyhton, I actually understand the OO
principles that are in the book.

I have also never done OO in python, so that is exciting and new!

I have also never used magit. Magit is a interface for git via emacs. If you
have never used it, it may change your life.

So this whole thing is just a learning experience for me, in between calculus
homework.

Let me take a moment to highly recommend the afore mentioned book.
I did object oriented programming for the first time last quarter in Java.
The class was about linear data structures. It was incredibly painful.
Some of that I credit to Java. I find the philosophy of the language
distasteful. Having read some of this book, I think a larger degree of my pain
was due to my deep fundamental lack of comprehension of why I would use objects.
